## Description

A social network created with React, A-Frame, MongoDB and NodeJs for artists and innovators to share their 3d objects in virtual environments.



## User Stories

- **404:** As an anon/user I can see a 404 page if I try to reach a page that does not exist so that I know it's my fault

- **Signup:** As an anon I can sign up in the platform so that I can start playing into competition

- **Login:** As a user I can login to the platform so that I can play competitions

- **Logout:** As a user I can logout from the platform so no one else can use it

- See my profile: As a user I can view my profile

- Edit profile: As a user I can edit my profile

- Add 3D object to my environment: As a user I can upload a 3D object (.glb format) to the virtual environment

-  View other user profiles: As a user I can view the profiles of other users

- Create/update/delete comments: As a user I can make/delete/update comments

- Search users and themes: As a user I can use the search bar to search users and themes by hashtag

  




## Backlog
